      I wanted to hightlight 2 of my favourite projects in this section. They both show great progress and mark the Journey into different areas of game dev. 
      Mobile games and game audio.

      Im proud of all the projects ive made, they all add to my personal development. Some other games to look out for when you browse my Itch.io page are, the VR ward 
      Which explored an area outside of games and and one of my personal favourites and game jam award winner Yang and Ying a simple platformer with a twist!

    <p>This is my first mobile game. You can currently only play it on my itch.io page through the Chrome Browser. But, I have gone through the testing
      phase on the Google Play store. A few bugs were discovered so release was delayed. But all good experience and I’ll be releasing this game early next year potentially,
      depending on my current job status. It's my main project and focus outside of freelance work. The mobile game industry is the sector I want to explore the most,
      as I think it suits my style and game ideas — simple, addictive, and coherent games!

    <p>
      This project I'm extra proud of. I worked in a group of 4 to recreate the audio of one of my existing games. 
      I added another layer of mechanics ready to implement new audio. The game was very barebones before this project, 
      it was desperate for an upgrade. I would like to explore game audio more in the future.
