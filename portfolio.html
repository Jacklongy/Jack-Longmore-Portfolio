    <p>This is my first mobile game. You can currently only play it on my itch.io page through the Chrome Browser. But, I have gone through the testing
      phase on the Google Play store. A few bugs were discovered so release was delayed. But all good experience and I’ll be releasing this game early next year potentially,
      depending on my current job status. It's my main project and focus outside of freelance work. The mobile game industry is the sector I want to explore the most,
      as I think it suits my style and game ideas — simple, addictive, and coherent games!

      This project I'm extra proud of. I worked in a group of 4 to recreate the audio of one of my existing games. 
      I added another layer of mechanics ready to implement new audio. The game was very barebones before this project, 
      it was desperate for an upgrade. I would like to explore game audio more in the future.

      Although I'm not the biggest fan of this game, I think it's very important to show my diversity with exploring other game engines and 3D worlds. UE4 - 5 showed me another side to game development,
      from Visual Scripting and Blueprints to the amazing graphical capabilities. I also worked with Maya and Blender to create 3D models.
